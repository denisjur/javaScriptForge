const jonas = "I'm " + firstName + ", a " + (year - birthYear)

/* As you can see this can be a pain, so there is a better way "Template literals":
So a Template Literal can assemble multiple pieces into one final sting.*/
const jonasNew = `I'm ${firstName}, a ${year - birthYear} year old ${job}!`;

//Or you could use Backticks and only type enter. This would also work:

console. log(`String with
multiple
lines`);

// Asignment Strings and Template:

const myContinent = "Europe";
